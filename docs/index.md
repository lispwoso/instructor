Instructor makes it easy to get structured data like JSON from LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-Vision, and open-source models including [Mistral/Mixtral](./hub/together.md), [Anyscale](./hub/anyscale.md), [Ollama](./hub/ollama.md), and [llama-cpp-python](./hub/llama-cpp-python.md).

It stands out for its simplicity, transparency, and user-centric design, built on top of Pydantic. Instructor helps you manage [validation context](./concepts/reask_validation.md), retries with [Tenacity](./concepts/retrying.md), and streaming [Lists](./concepts/lists.md) and [Partial](./concepts/partial.md) responses.

- Instructor provides support for a wide range of programming languages, including:
  - [Python](https://python.useinstructor.com)
  - [TypeScript](https://js.useinstructor.com)
  - [Ruby](https://ruby.useinstructor.com)
  - [Go](https://go.useinstructor.com)
  - [Elixir](https://hex.pm/packages/instructor)
  - [Rust](https://rust.useinstructor.com/)

## Why use Instructor?

The question of using Instructor is fundamentally a question of why to use Pydantic.

1. **Powered by type hints** — Instructor is powered by Pydantic, which is powered by type hints. Schema validation, prompting is controlled by type annotations; less to learn, less code to write, and integrates with your IDE.

2. **Customizable** — Pydantic is highly customizable. You can define your own validators, custom error messages, and more.

3. **Ecosystem** Pydantic is the most widely used data validation library for Python with over 100M downloads a month. It's used by FastAPI, Typer, and many other popular libraries.

## Getting Started

```
pip install -U instructor
```

If you ever get stuck, you can always run `instructor docs` to open the documentation in your browser. It even supports searching for specific topics.

You can also check out our [cookbooks](./examples/index.md) and [concepts](./concepts/models.md) to learn more about how to use Instructor.

Now, let's see Instructor in action with a simple example:

### Using OpenAI

??? info "Want to use OpenAI's Structured Output Response?"

    We've added support for OpenAI's structured output response. With this, you'll get all the benefits of instructor you like with the constrained sampling from OpenAI.

    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI
    from instructor import from_openai, Mode
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    client = from_openai(OpenAI(), mode=Mode.TOOLS_STRICT)


    class User(BaseModel):
        name: str
        age: int


    resp = client.chat.completions.create(
        response_model=User,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
            }
        ],
        model="gpt-4o",
    )
    ```

```python
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI


# Define your desired output structure
class UserInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


# Patch the OpenAI client
client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())

# Extract structured data from natural language
user_info = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=UserInfo,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "John Doe is 30 years old."}],
)

print(user_info.name)
#> John Doe
print(user_info.age)
#> 30
```

### Using Anthropic

```python
import instructor
from anthropic import Anthropic
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_anthropic(Anthropic())

# note that client.chat.completions.create will also work
resp = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
        }
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

assert isinstance(resp, User)
assert resp.name == "Jason"
assert resp.age == 25
```

### Using Gemini

#### Google AI

```python
import instructor
import google.generativeai as genai
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_gemini(
    client=genai.GenerativeModel(
        model_name="models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest",
    ),
    mode=instructor.Mode.GEMINI_JSON,
)

# note that client.chat.completions.create will also work
resp = client.messages.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
        }
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

assert isinstance(resp, User)
assert resp.name == "Jason"
assert resp.age == 25
```

#### Vertex AI

**Note**: Gemini Tool Calling is still in preview, and there are some limitations. You can learn more about them in the [Vertex AI examples notebook](../hub/vertexai.md).

```python
import instructor
import vertexai  # type: ignore
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel  # type: ignore
from pydantic import BaseModel

vertexai.init()


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_vertexai(
    client=GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-pro-preview-0409"),
    mode=instructor.Mode.VERTEXAI_TOOLS,
)

# note that client.chat.completions.create will also work
resp = client.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
        }
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

assert isinstance(resp, User)
assert resp.name == "Jason"
assert resp.age == 25
```

### Using Litellm

```python
import instructor
from litellm import completion
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_litellm(completion)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
        }
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

assert isinstance(resp, User)
assert resp.name == "Jason"
assert resp.age == 25
```

### Using Cohere

We also support users who want to use the Cohere models using the `from_cohere` method.

??? info "Want to get the original Cohere response?"

    If you want to get the original response object from the LLM instead of a structured output, you can pass `response_model=None` to the `create` method. This will return the raw response from the underlying API.

    ```python
    # This will return the original Cohere response object
    raw_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        response_model=None,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
            }
        ],
    )
    ```

    This can be useful when you need access to additional metadata or want to handle the raw response yourself.

```python
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel
from cohere import Client


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_cohere(Client())

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    response_model=User,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract Jason is 25 years old.",
        }
    ],
)

assert resp.name == "Jason"
assert resp.age == 25
```

## Correct Typing

This was the dream of instructor but due to the patching of openai, it wasnt possible for me to get typing to work well. Now, with the new client, we can get typing to work well! We've also added a few `create_*` methods to make it easier to create iterables and partials, and to access the original completion.

### Calling `create`

```python
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI())

user = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create a user"},
    ],
    response_model=User,
)
```

Now if you use a IDE, you can see the type is correctly infered.

### Handling async: `await create`

This will also work correctly with asynchronous clients.

```python
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel


client = instructor.from_openai(openai.AsyncOpenAI())


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


async def extract():
    return await client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "Create a user"},
        ],
        response_model=User,
    )
```

Notice that simply because we return the `create` method, the `extract()` function will return the correct user type.

![async](./blog/posts/img/async_type.png)

### Returning the original completion: `create_with_completion`

You can also return the original completion object

```python
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel


client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI())


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


user, completion = client.chat.completions.create_with_completion(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create a user"},
    ],
    response_model=User,
)
```

![with_completion](./blog/posts/img/with_completion.png)

### Streaming Partial Objects: `create_partial`

In order to handle streams, we still support `Iterable[T]` and `Partial[T]` but to simply the type inference, we've added `create_iterable` and `create_partial` methods as well!

```python
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel


client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI())


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


user_stream = client.chat.completions.create_partial(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create a user"},
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

for user in user_stream:
    print(user)
    #> name=None age=None
    #> name=None age=None
    #> name=None age=None
    #> name=None age=None
    #> name=None age=25
    #> name=None age=25
    #> name=None age=25
    #> name=None age=25
    #> name=None age=25
    #> name=None age=25
    #> name='John Doe' age=25
    # name=None age=None
    # name='' age=None
    # name='John' age=None
    # name='John Doe' age=None
    # name='John Doe' age=30
```

Notice now that the type infered is `Generator[User, None]`

### Streaming Iterables: `create_iterable`

We get an iterable of objects when we want to extract multiple objects.

```python
import openai
import instructor
from pydantic import BaseModel


client = instructor.from_openai(openai.OpenAI())


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


users = client.chat.completions.create_iterable(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create 2 users"},
    ],
    response_model=User,
)

for user in users:
    print(user)
    #> name='John Doe' age=30
    #> name='Jane Doe' age=28
    # User(name='John Doe', age=30)
    # User(name='Jane Smith', age=25)
```
